# Development Plan for Billing and Stock Management App Using .NET MAUI Blazor with Google Drive

## 1. Project Overview
This development plan outlines the steps to build a cross-platform billing and stock management app for Indian merchant stores using .NET MAUI Blazor with free tools, replacing Supabase with Google Drive for cloud storage (15 GB free tier). The app will support Windows 7 SP1 and later, Android (5.0+), iOS (11+), and macOS (10.15+), incorporating Vyapar-inspired features like customizable GST invoices, barcode generation, and WhatsApp sharing. It uses MudBlazor Charts for data visualization and ensures offline functionality with Google Drive synchronization.

  - **Mitigation**: Optimize MudBlazor components (lazy-loading, minimal DOM updates); test with .NET Framework 4.8.
- **Google Drive Limitations**:
  - **Challenge**: 15 GB storage limit; no real-time database or API rate limits.
  - **Mitigation**: Compress JSON/CSV files; implement efficient sync logic; advise merchants on storage management.
- **Payment Gateway Absence**:
  - **Challenge**: No free UPI/card APIs.
  - **Mitigation**: Robust manual payment recording; monitor for free APIs.
- **Multilingual Rendering**:
  - **Challenge**: Complex scripts (e.g., Devanagari) may render poorly.
  - **Mitigation**: Use Noto Serif fonts; test CSS with Tailwind.
- **Google Drive Sync Complexity**:
  - **Challenge**: Lacks Supabase’s real-time database and authentication features.
  - **Mitigation**: Use SQLite for local data; implement periodic JSON/CSV sync with Google Drive.
